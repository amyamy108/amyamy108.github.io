I don't think anyone would expect me to be here. Unlikely, anyway, with such an arts heavy background. My icebreaker at networking events is usually "I majored in theater and art history, so I *really* didn't care about getting a job." ... which, in turn, usually elicits a few pity chuckles. But at least we all know where we stand.  We're all on the same page now. I'm "one of those creative types," good for a few quips while the consultants continue their one-ups-man banter. That's how DC happy hours feel, anyway. But there's a huge entrepreneurial opportunity lurking, right under their nose. I'm just here to build it. 

Art, in all of its forms, is massively underappreciated and recklessly underutilized. It has the ability to combine aesthetics and philosophy and empathy and life's complexity in one, instantly comprehensible package. We use art in our communications, our sales, our family gatherings, our emotional life. Clearly, it is one of humanity's most effective tool. Not unlike tech. Beyond versatility, performing arts teach a plethora of transferable skills: public speaking, emotional intelligence, research and evaluation, team work, vocal training, creativity, ingenuity, resourcefulness, etc.

After moving to DC, I worked at a series of premiere arts and culture institutions. Each new position taught me valuable lessons in marketing, company management, and program design. However, the industry does face systemic issues - fewer subscribers, more competition, and the desperate need to connect with new audiences to name a few. Most arts organizations function as non-profits, and the dependence on annual fundraising is (at least to the uninitiated) alarming. There are solutions to these problems. To addresses them, I figured it's time to buff-up my skill set. 

TLDR; Tech could be the answer to many arts industry issues. Let's find out!
