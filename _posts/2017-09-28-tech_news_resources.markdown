As I sit here, resentment growing towards the game Tic Tac Toe at large, I decided to better myself (read: take a break) and see what's up in the tech world. Budding programmers need to stay ahead of not just language development, but news, events, the culture and our role within it. 

I don't know a ton about reputable references, but at the very least I've compiled this list (from other lists) to suss it out. Everyday, I'll peruse a selection of these resources and share those pertinent things. 

*note* these are news outlets. Other sites discuss language specific code, which I'll get to in a later post. 

*2nd note* also search reddit/ slack/ facebook/ other online community groups. Crowd sourced information is the best. 

*3rd note* fun fact, the -st -nd -rd -th that sometimes follow numbers are called ordinals. The more you know.
